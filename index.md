### CPSC 120

Lab 8 part 2 was one of my favorites because we used loops to make patterns which I thought were cool.I was my first time using loops to make something like that. Even though it was hard I liked it a lot.

Lab 12 part 1 and 2 were also one of my favorites because it was something much more different then what we used to do in the labs. To creat some type of image, that was my first time going that. It was hard and it took a while to finish it but I felt that it was worth it for the final product. 

Lab 9 part 2 is also another of my favorits because I thought that it was fun making game were you need to find the secret number.For me this lab was really hard because for some reason so my partner was really helpful.
